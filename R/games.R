## Follow Allen et al 2017 to simulate evolutionary games on arbitrary networks
## Death-birth updating
## Assumes undirected graphs, but I guess that could be changed?
##
## Required parameters:
#### Î· :: selection strength
#### b :: benefit in donation game
#### c :: cost in donation game
#### g :: network (not really a parameter: it's the space)
## Seed
#### x_i :: node states

## TODO
## Check with weights. No expectations, though? Just need to make sure the weights are being used.
## Roxygenize.

## assumes igraph
## should probably parallelize...
